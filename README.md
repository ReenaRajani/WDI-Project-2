1. Introduction and Background
------------------------------

Drawsome is the brainchild of four bright-eyed General Assembly Web Development Immersive students: Toby, Michael, Reena and Charles. Drawsome is a game designed for 3-8 players which features real-time HTML5 Canvas drawing in a pictionary styled game. 

In an attempt to learn more about web sockets, responsive design, HTML5 Canvas and different rails gem, Drawsome allows us to combine these features to make a clone of one of our favorite games, Drawful by Jackful games.

2. Version
----------

v1.0 
####

The first version of this software will allow for a single game to be played with 3-8 players. There will be a chat window for communication and real-time drawing using websockets.

3. User Guide
-------------

Please Note: To play Drawsome, users are required to create an account on the drawsome.heroku.com website.

After signing in, users are automatically taken to a lobby screen where they wait for other players. This screen will automatically update when players join or leave the game and when players update their status to ready.

In order for a game to begin, there must be at least 3 players and every active player must have marked themselves as ready. Once this condition has been met, the game will begin automatically.
